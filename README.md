# danazkari/minica

A base project for generating minica certificates for local development

## What made me create this repo

I was trying to setup quickly HTTPS with traefik on my local machine for development, minica sounded like a perfect solution but
I didn't want to ask my team to install go just to run this, so I looked in docker-hub and didn't find any relevant or newly maintained
images.

So, in a very open-source fasioned way, I went directly to github, created a repo and here's the project.

## Contributing

By all means contribute whenever possible, PRs are more than welcome!
